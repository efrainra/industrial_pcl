TO RUN THIS PERCEPTION DEMO

1. You'll nee to have pcl17 installed somewhere in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
	1a. svn or git checkout: https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/tree/fuerte-unstable-devel
		within the pcl17 package, you'll need to change the Makefile document
			line 120: 	-DBUILD_apps=ON \
		and do a rosmake for pcl17 and pcl17_ros (pcl17 will take FOREVER)

2. You'll need a solid model (.ply) of an object of interest
	save the .ply file to a destination, and change recognition.launch "ply_model_path" accordingly

3. There is a hard-coded string at the beginning of recognition_node.cpp - you will need to change this path
	line 76: std::ofstream STATFILE_("/home/cgomez/ros/fuerte/swri-ros-pkg_trunk_recognition_testing/mantis/mantis_perception/data/meshes/demo_parts/pump1.csv");
	line 76 example: std::ofstream STATFILE_("/home/user/Desktop/pump1.csv");

4. Do a rosmake in indstrial_object_recognition_pcl17

Two options for running demo:
OPTION 1
checkout industrial_pcl_filters from the same stack (industrial_pcl)
	Open 4 terminals:
	Terminal 1: roslaunch industrial_object_recognition_pcl17 camera.launch
	Terminal 2: rosrun rviz rviz
	Terminal 3: roslaunch industrial_pcl_filters test_node.launch 
	Terminal 4: roslaunch industrial_object_recognition_pcl17 recognition.launch 
OPTION 2
change recognition.launch param topic to "ur5_arm_kinect/depth_registered/points"
	Open 3 terminals:
	Terminal 1: roslaunch industrial_object_recognition_pcl17 camera.launch
	Terminal 2: rosrun rviz rviz
	Terminal 3: roslaunch industrial_object_recognition_pcl17 recognition.launch
