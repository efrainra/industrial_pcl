This package utilizes tools in PCL 1.7 to perform the taks of object recognition. 

TO RUN THIS PERCEPTION DEMO

1. Check out this code/repository

2. You'll nee to have pcl17 installed somewhere in your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
	2a. svn or git checkout: https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl/tree/fuerte-unstable-devel
	(git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl.git -b fuerte-unstable-devel pcl_branch)
		within the pcl17 package, you'll need to change the Makefile document
			line 120: 	-DBUILD_apps=ON \
		and do a rosmake for pcl17 and pcl17_ros (pcl17 will take FOREVER)
		(note: my rosmake crashed in pcl17, so I had to do a regular make)

3. Make sure you have the ros-industrial package "industrial_utils" installed/checked out.

4. You'll need a solid model (.ply) of an object of interest
	save the .ply file to a destination, and change recognition.launch "ply_model_path" accordingly

5. Also in that recognition.launch file, make sure to change the "model_list" param to the .ply file name

6. There is a hard-coded string at the beginning of recognition_node.cpp - you will need to change this path
	line 76: std::ofstream STATFILE_("/home/cgomez/ros/fuerte/swri-ros-pkg_trunk_recognition_testing/mantis/mantis_perception/data/meshes/demo_parts/pump1.csv");
	line 76 example: std::ofstream STATFILE_("/home/user/Desktop/name.csv");

7. Do a rosmake in indstrial_object_recognition_pcl17
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two options for running demo:
OPTION 1
	Open 3 terminals:
	Terminal 1: roslaunch industrial_object_recognition_pcl17 camera.launch
	Terminal 2: rosrun rviz rviz
	Terminal 3: roslaunch industrial_object_recognition_pcl17 recognition.launch
OPTION 2
checkout industrial_pcl_filters from the same stack (industrial_pcl)
change recognition.launch param topic to "avg_filtered_cloud"
	Open 4 terminals:
	Terminal 1: roslaunch industrial_object_recognition_pcl17 camera.launch
	Terminal 2: rosrun rviz rviz
	Terminal 3: roslaunch industrial_pcl_filters test_node.launch 
	Terminal 4: roslaunch industrial_object_recognition_pcl17 recognition.launch
